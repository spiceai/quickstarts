## Exploring SQL-Based Search

Spice supports traditional SQL query patterns, allowing users to execute straightforward text searches across a dataset using SQL's `LIKE` clause. Below is an example:

### Getting Started with SQL Search

1. **Basic Pattern Search**
   ```sql
   SELECT id, text_column
   FROM my_table
   WHERE
       LOWER(text_column) LIKE '%search_term%'
     AND
       date_published > '2021-01-01'
   ```
   Use the above query for simple keyword searches within your dataset.

## Leveraging Vector-Based Search

### Advanced Vector Search with Spice

Beyond SQL, Spice offers advanced vector-based search functionality. This feature supports:

- **Local Embedding Models**, e.g., [all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2).
- **Remote Embedding Providers**, e.g., [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/embeddings/create).

### Configuring Vector Search

1. **Defining Your Embeddings**:
   Embeddings are configured within the `spicepod.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   embeddings:
     - from: openai
       name: remote_service
       params:
         openai_api_key: ${ secrets:SPICE_OPENAI_API_KEY }

     - name: local_embedding_model
       from: huggingface:huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
   ```

2. **Augmenting Datasets with Embeddings**:
   To perform similarity searches:

   ```yaml
   datasets:
     - from: github:github.com/spiceai/spiceai/issues
       name: spiceai.issues
       acceleration:
         enabled: true
       embeddings:
         - column: body
           use: local_embedding_model
   ```
   This setup targets the `body` column of the dataset for embedding, allowing nuanced search capabilities.

3. **Executing a Search Query**:
   Use curl to perform a vector-based search:

   ```shell
   curl -XPOST http://localhost:8090/v1/search \\
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\
     -d '{
       "datasets": ["spiceai.issues"],
       "text": "cutting edge AI",
       "where": "author=\"jeadie\"",
       "additional_columns": ["title", "state"],
       "limit": 2
     }'
   ```

### Additional Features

**Chunking Support**: Spice supports chunking large text columns, ensuring only relevant text portions are retrieved during searches.

```yaml
datasets:
  - ...
    embeddings:
      - column: body
        use: local_embedding_model
        chunking:
          enabled: true
          target_chunk_size: 512
```

**Document Retrieval**: Retrieve full content by including the embedding column in `additional_columns` when using vector-based search.

### Conclusion

Welcome to the new world of searching with Spice, combining traditional SQL with cutting-edge vector search. For full API details, refer to the [API reference for /v1/search](/api/http/search).
