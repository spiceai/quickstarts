# Quickstart: Running Spice as a Docker Container

Quickstart demonstrates how to run Spice.ai OSS as a container. The quickstart uses [MySQL Sakila Sample Database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/sakila-structure-tables.html) run as a container with Spice using Docker Compose configuration and Open AI model to perform vector search and natural language queries to the dataset.

## Prerequisites

- Update the `.env` file with your OpenAI API key. If the API key is not available, you can proceed and ignore the `Unable to load LLM from spicepod openai` warning. Note that the Language Model section cannot be tested in this case.
- Docker is installed: [Install Docker Image](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- Spice CLI is installed: [Getting Started](https://docs.spiceai.org/getting-started)

## Run Spice as a Docker Container

Review Spice Docker image configuration:

```shell
cat Dockerfile
```

Output:

```shell
FROM spiceai/spiceai:latest-models

# Copy the Spicepod configuration file
COPY spicepod.yaml /app/spicepod.yaml

# Copy the .env.local & .env files
COPY .env* /app/

# Spice runtime start-up arguments
CMD ["--http","0.0.0.0:8090","--metrics", "0.0.0.0:9090","--flight","0.0.0.0:50051"]

EXPOSE 8090
EXPOSE 9090
EXPOSE 50051

# Start the Spicepod%                                                                  

```

Use Docker Compose to build and run the docker image:

```shell
docker-compose up --build
```

Output

```shell
⚡ docker-compose up --build
 => [spiced internal] load build definition from Dockerfile                       0.0s

Observe that the `films` dataset is successfully loaded.

```shell
Dataset films registered (mysql:film), acceleration (arrow), results cache enabled.
```

You now have Spice running as a Docker container with Flight and HTTP ports exposed on ports `50051` and `8090`. Run `spice status` to access Spice.ai runtime information.

```shell
NAME          ENDPOINT        STATUS 
http          0.0.0.0:8090    Ready  
flight        0.0.0.0:50051   Ready  
metrics       0.0.0.0:9090    Ready  
opentelemetry 127.0.0.1:50052 Ready 
```

### SQL Search

Run `spice sql` and execute the following query to select the top 10 films with the highest average rental score.

```sql
SELECT 
  title, 
  AVG(rental_rate) AS avg_rental_rate
FROM films
GROUP BY title
ORDER BY avg_rental_rate DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

Output:

```shell
+---------------------+-----------------+
| title               | avg_rental_rate |
+---------------------+-----------------+
| ATTRACTION NEWTON   | 4.990000        |
| ALADDIN CALENDAR    | 4.990000        |
| ELEMENT FREDDY      | 4.990000        |
| BACKLASH UNDEFEATED | 4.990000        |
| DOGMA FAMILY        | 4.990000        |
+---------------------+-----------------+
```

### Using Language Model

Run `spice chat`

```shell
Using model: openai
chat> what datasets you have access to
I have access to the following dataset:

- **Films Dataset**: Available in the `spice.public.films` table.

chat> what is the average rental duration
The average rental duration is approximately 4.99 days.
```
